Design system:
- Headline/logo font: Cinzel (all-caps, letterspaced/tracked)
- Body font: Inter (high readability)
- Optional rules font: IBM Plex Mono (short “non-negotiables” blocks only)

Color palette:
- Charcoal: #111214 (primary text/logo)
- Bone: #F4F0E8 (primary background)
- Brass: #B08D57 (primary accent; dividers, icons, section numbers, highlights)
- Oxblood: #6B0F1A (rare emphasis; warnings/anchor callouts only, max 0–1 times per page)
- Slate: #2A2F36 (secondary headings/labels)
- Ash Gray: #6B7280 (metadata/captions; avoid for long paragraphs)

Visual style:
Premium minimalism, generous whitespace, thin brass dividers, simple line icons.
Avoid medieval/cosplay visuals, weapons, edgy aggression, neon colors, gradients, and meme aesthetics.

Deliverables must be structured, actionable, and easy to scan (headings, bullets, frameworks, checklists).
